### My name is Erik. I like helping others get into data analysis, software development, and AWS.

Follow me to learn various data, software, and AWS concepts by watching me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWlNrTU1a8t7lKCkqesn9A) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/datadeverik).

Work with me to use programming to advance your career. I coach adult learners to help them apply the disciplined logic and creative possibilities of coding to their careers. See [this page](https://www.datadeverik.com/coaching).

Keep up to date with my efforts by reading [my blog](https://blog.datadeverik.com/newsletter).

I am also the "Captain" of [Moline Harbor Digital Solutions](https://www.molineharbor.com).

You may contact me on Discord as "datadeverik" or by gmail as [datadeverik](mailto:datadeverik@gmail.com).
